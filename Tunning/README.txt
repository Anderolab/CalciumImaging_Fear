2. Check if Iterations = 1000 (line 151)
3. RUN
4. Select the Experiment file
5. Select the folder in which you want to save the results
6. Enter the number of lists (ex. 4) [this is the number of groups you want to do your analysis for. Example: fem veh, male treatment, ...]
7.  Enter a name for list 1 (Ex. Male_veh) [CAREFUL No spaces after the name of the list (Ex.: 'Male '), it will give you an error]
8. Enter numbers for "Males" (separated by spaces): 1 2 3 7 8 9

10. Select your folder containing the Good Neurones
11. Â¿Desea eliminar las neuronas malas para M1? (s/n):
12. Do it for all the animals
13. Do you want to analyze (1) All Tones/Shock/ITI or (2) Binned? Enter 1 or 2:
	Choose the type of analysis you prefer to do:
	- (1) All Tones/Shock/ITI: takes into consideration all the Tones/Shock/ITI as one;
	- (2) Binned: groups the interval of your choice into bins (how many you prefer);
IF (1)
14. What interval do you want to analyse: 
	Choose one of the proposed intervals and write it 
IF (2)
14.1 How many bins do you want? (Ex. 2)
14.2 Enter tones/shocks for Bin 1 (separated by spaces): 1 2 
     Enter tones/shocks for Bin 2 (separated by spaces): 3 4 5

15. Do you want to take a specific interval as reference? If yes, write it. If done, press Enter: 
	- If you want to take the entire session as a reference just press ENTER
